```{r message=FALSE , echo = FALSE}

```

## Distribution of customers' ages: What is the distribution of customers' ages? Are there any dominant age groups?

```{r}
Data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, fill = age)) +
  geom_bar() +
  scale_x_discrete(name = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Number of clients") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Conclusions: The data has lots of "Middle-Aged Adults" and "Older Adults," showing they're focused on. But there aren't as many "Younger Adults" or "Seniors," so they might not have been as important in the campaign.

## Relationship between age and deposit subscription: Is there a connection between age and subscribing to a deposit? Are certain age groups more inclined towards subscribing?

```{r}
Data %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, fill = y)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Proportion of term deposit subscriptions", fill = "Has the client subscribed a term deposit?") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Conclusions: There appears to be a correlation between age and subscribing to a deposit. Younger Adults and Seniors show a higher inclination towards subscribing to deposits compared to Middle-Aged and Older Adults.

## Annual balance and subscription: Is the average annual balance of clients connected to deposit subscription?

```{r}
Data %>%
  group_by(y) %>%
  summarise(avg_balance = mean(balance)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = y, y = avg_balance, fill = y)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

## Contact duration and subscription: Does the duration of the last contact relate to deposit subscription?

```{r}
Data %>%
  mutate(
    duration = duration / 60,
    duration_group = cut(duration, breaks = c(-1, 5, 15, max(duration) + 1), labels = c("Short", "Long", "Very long")), right = TRUE
  ) %>%
  group_by(duration_group) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = duration_group, fill = y)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")

```

Conclusions: There seems to be a relationship between the duration of the last contact and deposit subscription. Longer contacts tend to have a higher number of deposit subscriptions compared to shorter contacts.

## Is there a correlation between outcome of the prevoius campaign and the subscription to a term deposit in the current campaign?

```{r}
Data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = poutcome, fill = y)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")

```

Conclusions: This implies that the outcome of the previous campaign might influence the subscription behavior in the current campaign, suggesting a correlation between these variables.

## Is the marital status of clients (Marital) correlated with the subscription to a term deposit (Y)?

```{r}
Data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = marital, fill = y)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")

```

Conclusions: There is not a trend indicating a strong correlation between marital status and subscription to a term deposit

## How does the job status relate to the subscription of a term deposit?

```{r}
Data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = job, fill = y)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")

```

Conclusions: The data suggests that job status might have some influence on the subscription to a term deposit, as evidenced by varying subscription counts among different job categories. Yet, this relationship isn't straightforward or consistent across all job types, indicating that other factors might also play a role in determining subscription behavior.

## How does the education level relate to the subscription of a term deposit?

```{r}
Data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = education, fill = y)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

Conclusions: The data suggests a correlation between education level and the subscription to a term deposit. Higher education levels, specifically tertiary education, seem to be associated with a higher likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit.
